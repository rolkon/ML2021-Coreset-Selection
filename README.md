# Core-Set Selection for Effective Data Selection

This repository contains the source code of the Skoltech ML2021 course project "Core-Set Selection for Effective Data Selection".

### Structure and contents

All source code is implemented in jupyter-notebooks and can be found in the `src` folder. In some situations, python files are created from the notebooks to be used elsewhere, but the implementation itself is done in jupyter-notebooks. This is done to build the documentation and test environment directly around the code.

Folder structure:
* `src/` contains the source code of the project.
  * `greedy_k_centers` contains the implementation of the Greedy K-Centers algorithm.
  * `glister` contains the implementation of the GLISTER algorithm.
