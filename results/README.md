DNA. Test accuracies of: (1)GLISTER-ONLINE models (internal optimization), (2) shallow net trained on core-sets of
10%, 30% and 50% of the train data set generated by the core-set selection methods, (3) shallow net train
on random subsets of the train data, (4) shallow net trained on full train sample
